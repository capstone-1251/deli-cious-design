        <p>What started as a simple dream grew into something truly special. For over 20 years, Glen and Wendy poured
          their hearts into building a life — and a little deli — in the heart of Jasper. Through long days, hard work,
          and a whole lot of love, they turned that dream into a cornerstone of the community.</p>
        <p>When Patricia Street Deli opened its doors in 2004, Glen had one goal: do the simple things right. He never set
          out to build an empire — just a place that served honest food with a smile, where everyone felt welcome. No
          frills, no fuss — just fresh ingredients, warm bread, and a big dose of heart.</p>
        <p>What started as a small sandwich shop quickly became something much more. The Deli became a gathering place —
          where locals shared stories, hikers thawed out after mountain adventures, and travelers from around the world
          came to feel a little bit at home.</p>
        <p>Wendy became the heart of it all — the mom everyone wished they had. Her kindness, wisdom, and comforting hugs
          lifted countless spirits. Glen, with his easy humor and genuine warmth, made every guest feel like an old
          friend.</p>
        <p>Together, they created something rare — a place where food wasn’t just eaten, it was shared. Laughter filled
          the air, the smell of fresh bread drifted down the street, and everyone who walked in left a little lighter than
          when they arrived.</p>
        <p>Patricia Street Deli became part of Jasper’s heartbeat. People came for the sandwiches, but they stayed for the
          feeling — that unmistakable sense of connection, comfort, and belonging that only Glen and Wendy could create.

      <div class="content">
        <p>Over the years, something beautiful happened on Patricia Street. What began as a cozy little sandwich shop grew
          into a Jasper tradition — a place woven into the fabric of the town itself. Locals made it part of their daily
          rhythm, and travelers from all over the world began sharing the same advice: “You have to stop by the Deli.”</p>
        <p>Patricia Street Deli didn’t thrive because of flash or fame — it thrived because of heart. Glen and his team
          built their success one smile, one conversation, one perfectly stacked sandwich at a time. They remembered your
          name, asked about your hike, and made every visit feel like home.</p>
        <p>As word spread, the tiny 570-square-foot space buzzed with life. Lines stretched out the door, laughter filled
          the air, and the smell of fresh bread became part of downtown Jasper’s charm. It was proof that genuine care
          never goes out of style.</p>
        <p>The Deli grew with the seasons, always fresh and real, but never losing its soul. Glen and Wendy gave back to
          the town that gave them so much — hiring local youth, supporting community events, and pouring their hearts into
          making Jasper proud.</p>
        <p>Before the fire, Patricia Street Deli had reached its peak — bursting at the seams, filled with the same warmth
          and joy that had fueled it from the start. It wasn’t just a restaurant anymore. It was part of Jasper’s story —
          a living reminder of what passion, perseverance, and love can create.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>On July 22, 2024, everything changed.</p>
        <p>The wildfire that swept through Jasper took with it more than just buildings — it took memories, history, and
          the home Glen and Wendy had spent two decades building.</p>
        <p>They had weathered storms before — from the challenges of COVID to the daily grind of running a small business
          — but nothing could prepare them for this. Patricia Street Deli, a beloved community hub and symbol of
          connection, was gone in a heartbeat.</p>
        <p>As evacuation orders came, they gathered their cats and left with little more than what they could carry. From
          the road, messages and photos flooded in — their town, their livelihood, their life — burning before their eyes.
          They called their kids and wept. The grief was overwhelming, but even in that moment, they searched for hope.
        </p>
        <p>Somewhere between the heartbreak and the highway, they made a promise to each other: “Home is wherever I’m with
          you.”</p>
        <p>Seven months later, with the love and encouragement of their children, Jaimie and Dustin, Glen and Wendy
          decided it was time to rebuild. As a family — and as a team — they chose to rise again, doing what they do best:
          making sandwiches, making memories, and making friends.</p>
        <p>This time, they would do it in a bigger space — four times the size of their original deli — in a city that
          felt ready to welcome them with open arms.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>After months of reflection and support from family, friends, and their Jasper community, Glen and Wendy made a
          brave decision — to turn heartbreak into hope. Edmonton felt like the perfect place to begin again: a city full
          of energy, kindness, and opportunity, where their story could continue to grow while staying rooted in the
          spirit of Jasper.</p>
        <p>The new Patricia Street Deli will carry forward everything people loved about the original — the warmth, the
          laughter, the feeling of belonging — while adding fresh seasonal flavours, expanded catering, and community
          events designed to bring people together.</p>
        <p>For Glen and Wendy, this isn’t about starting over. It’s about continuing a legacy built on resilience, love,
          and connection. They see Edmonton not as an ending, but as a new beginning — where the spirit of the mountains
          meets the heartbeat of the city.</p>
        <p>Patricia Street Deli has always been about more than food. It’s about people — the stories shared, the
          friendships formed, and the comfort of feeling at home. Now, that same heart and soul are finding a new home in
          Edmonton — ready to welcome both old friends and new faces with open arms and something special in every bite.

      <div class="content">
        <p>This photo of Dustin and Jaimie says it all — the teamwork, the respect, the rhythm. But what it doesn’t show
          is the depth of the story behind it.</p>
        <p>During the COVID years, when times were toughest, they showed up without hesitation. Dustin quietly sent money
          to keep creditors at bay and built systems that helped the business stay afloat. Jaimie balanced two jobs, a
          family, and still found the time to manage the books, streamline operations, and help rebuild stronger
          foundations.</p>
        <p>They never asked for anything in return — they just kept showing up, driven by love and belief in what their
          family had built.</p>
        <p>When fires hit Jasper in 2022, Dustin flew home from South America to help, and Jaimie drove out on weekends to
          keep things running. Their energy lifted Glen and Wendy when exhaustion and uncertainty set in.</p>
        <p>By 2023, hope had returned. Sales were up, the team was stronger, and the Deli was thriving again. That spring,
          Dustin and Jaimie officially became shareholders — the next generation ready to carry the torch.</p>
        <p>Then came the wildfire. Twelve days after celebrating 20 years in business, they lost everything once more. But
          even in the face of devastation, Dustin and Jaimie didn’t hesitate. </p>
        <p>They rolled up their sleeves and got to work — long hours, no complaints, just quiet determination and love for
          what Patricia Street Deli stands for.</p>
        <p>They believe in this place. They believe in their parents. And because of them, the Deli’s story continues.</p>
        <p>To Dustin and Jaimie — we love you, we are endlessly proud, and we wouldn’t be here without you.</p>
